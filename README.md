# Agent-Based Navigation in Graphs
* This project is an implementation of **agent-based navigation using graph-theoretic and information-theoretic measures**. 
* Inspired by Marcus Clements' [research](https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/22616/15007732%20CLEMENTS%20Marcus%20Final%20Version%20of%20MSc%20by%20Research%20Submission.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) on navigation in urban environments, the agent is designed to simulate decision-making in graph networks through two methods: **random walks** and **shortest pathfinding**.
* The agent stores visited nodes and performs simulations to compare movement strategies. Additionally, the project implements core graph metrics—**degree centrality**, **closeness centrality**, and **betweenness centrality**—derived from graph theory and information theory.

## Features:
- **Agent Simulation**: Simulates navigation in a graph through random walks and shortest paths.
- **Graph Metrics**: Calculates degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality to evaluate node importance.
- **Memory**: Tracks visited nodes during navigation to compare strategies.
- **Simulation Results**: Compares random walk and shortest path strategies over 1000 simulations.

## Research Paper
The work is based on the research paper "[Empowerment and Relevant Goal Information as Alternatives to Graph-Theoretic Centrality for Navigational Decision Making](https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/2299/22616/15007732%20CLEMENTS%20Marcus%20Final%20Version%20of%20MSc%20by%20Research%20Submission.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)" by Marcus Clements, which **explores the correlation between graph centrality and human navigation using empowerment and goal information measures**.

## Installation
- Clone the repository.
- Run main.py to start the simulations and calculate graph metrics.
- Results are saved as CSV files for easy analysis.

### Have a great day :)
