# empowered-graph-navigator
An agent-based navigation system inspired by Marcus Clements' research on empowerment and relevant goal information. The project simulates random walks and shortest paths in graphs, calculating metrics like degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality to explore decision-making in graph environments.
